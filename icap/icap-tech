=== Mesg Encapsulating
The ICAP encapsulation model is a lightweight means of packaging any number of HTTP message sections into an encapsulating ICAP message-body, in order to allow the vectoring of requests, responses, and request/response pairs to an ICAP server.
For example, the header 
```
Encapsulated: req-hdr=0, res-hdr=45, res-body=100
``` 
indicates a message that encapsulates a group of request headers, a group of response headers, 
and then a response body.  Each of these is included at the byte-offsets listed.
